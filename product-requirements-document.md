# Product Requirements Document (PRD): CodePath AI

## 1. Introduction

*   **Product Name:** CodePath AI (or user's chosen name for the app)
*   **Product Goal:** To provide an intuitive, AI-enhanced, cross-platform application for learning programming languages. The app will feature offline access and dynamically updated content, designed primarily for personal use without requiring user authentication.
*   **Tagline (Suggestion):** "Learn to code, anywhere, anytime, with AI by your side."

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

Our primary users are individuals at various stages of their programming journey who prefer a self-paced, flexible learning environment.

*   **Beginners:** Newcomers to programming seeking a structured and supportive introduction.
    *   **User Persona Example (Beginner Bob):**
        *   *Demographics:* 20s, student exploring career options or a professional looking to switch to a tech role.
        *   *Goals:* Wants to learn a foundational language like Python or JavaScript to build basic projects and understand core programming concepts. Needs a simple, non-intimidating learning path.
        *   *Pain Points:* Finds many online resources overwhelming or too theoretical; gets stuck easily without immediate help; needs to learn on the go (e.g., during commute) and requires offline access.
*   **Intermediate Learners:** Developers with some experience who want to learn new languages, frameworks, or advanced concepts.
    *   **User Persona Example (Intermediate Ivy):**
        *   *Demographics:* 30s, currently a web developer proficient in JavaScript and React.
        *   *Goals:* Wants to learn a new language like Rust or Go for a personal project, to explore different programming paradigms, or to enhance career prospects.
        *   *Pain Points:* Finds it challenging to locate curated, up-to-date advanced tutorials; has limited dedicated time for learning and needs efficient, focused content.
*   **Self-Learners/Hobbyists:** Individuals passionate about technology who learn for personal enrichment or specific projects.

## 3. Key Features & Prioritization

Features are prioritized to guide development, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

*   **P0 (Must-Have for MVP):**
    *   **Core Tutorial Content Delivery:** Ability to display and navigate through tutorial content for at least 2-3 initial programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS).
    *   **Basic Google Gemini API Integration:** Use Gemini API to fetch and display tutorial content (text-based instructions, code examples).
    *   **Cross-Platform Functionality:** Basic application shells for web (React) and mobile (React Native with Expo), accessible via a unified link/method.
    *   **Offline Storage & Access:** Core tutorial content (text, simple code snippets) available offline once downloaded.
    *   **Simple Navigation:** Intuitive navigation to select languages, browse tutorials, and move between lessons/sections.
    *   **Manual Web Content Update Mechanism:** A way for the user (developer) to trigger updates or add new content sourced from the web (initially manual, can be a script or simple interface).
*   **P1 (High Priority - Post-MVP Enhancements):**
    *   **Interactive Coding Exercises:** Simple in-app exercises (e.g., fill-in-the-blanks, small coding challenges) to reinforce learning.
    *   **Enhanced Gemini API Integration:** Explore features like AI-powered Q&A about code snippets, explanations of complex concepts, or code suggestions.
    *   **User Progress Tracking:** Local storage of completed tutorials/lessons for each language.
    *   **Expanded Language Library:** Gradually add more programming languages based on demand and content availability.
    *   **UI/UX Refinements:** Improve visual design and user experience based on initial usage.
    *   **Automated/Semi-Automated Web Content Update:** Develop a more robust system for fetching and integrating new/updated tutorials from predefined, trusted web sources.
*   **P2 (Medium Priority - Future Considerations):**
    *   **Advanced Search:** Allow users to search for specific topics, keywords, or code examples across all tutorials.
    *   **User Customization:** Options for theme (light/dark mode), font size, and other display preferences.
    *   **Rich Content Support:** Integration of images, diagrams, or short video clips within tutorials where beneficial.

## 4. Success Metrics

Given the personal use nature, success is measured by the app's utility and effectiveness for the primary user.

*   **Content Coverage & Depth:** Number of programming languages supported and the comprehensiveness of their tutorials.
*   **User Engagement (Self-Assessed):** Frequency of app usage, number of tutorials started and completed.
*   **Content Freshness & Relevance:** Regularity of content updates and their alignment with current programming practices.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Consistent and reliable access to content and features when offline.
*   **Ease of Use:** Intuitive navigation and a smooth learning experience.

## 5. Assumptions & Risks

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The user (developer) has a valid Google Gemini API key and understands its usage terms.
    *   High-quality, accurate learning content can be curated or developed for various programming languages.
    *   React and React Native (with Expo) are appropriate choices for achieving the desired cross-platform experience and offline capabilities for this personal project.
*   **Risks:**
    *   **API Key Security:** Accidental exposure of the Google Gemini API key if the project is shared or not handled carefully. (Mitigation: Store key in environment variables, avoid committing to public repositories. For a distributed app, a backend proxy would be essential.)
    *   **Content Quality and Copyright:** Ensuring that content sourced from the web is accurate, up-to-date, and respects intellectual property rights. (Mitigation: Use reputable sources, provide clear attribution if required, focus on original content generation where possible.)
    *   **Scalability of Content Management:** As the number of languages and tutorials grows, managing and updating content could become complex. (Mitigation: Plan for a structured content organization system from the start.)
    *   **Google Gemini API Changes:** Potential changes in API features, rate limits, or pricing that could impact the app's functionality or cost of operation. (Mitigation: Stay informed about API updates, design for graceful degradation if some API features become unavailable.)
    *   **Offline Data Synchronization Complexity:** If the app evolves to require synchronization of progress or content across multiple devices (beyond simple local storage), this can introduce significant complexity. (Mitigation: For personal use, local storage per device is simpler. If sync is needed, evaluate solutions like PouchDB/CouchDB or cloud backends with offline sync.)
    *   **Cross-Platform UI/UX Consistency:** Maintaining a consistent and high-quality user experience across both web and mobile platforms can be challenging. (Mitigation: Use shared components/logic where possible, test thoroughly on all target platforms.)
